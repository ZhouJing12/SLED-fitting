=== SLED_fitting_NGC6240_220328.ipynb ===

The origin fitting with two components gas.

=== SLED_NGC6240_dense_only_220402.ipynb ===

Constrain dense molecular gas component by HCN, HCO+, and cold dust component, using gas to dust ratio 100.

=== SLED_fitting_NGC6240_3comp_220404.ipynb ===

Fitting with abundance/Kvir ratio due to the degeneracy in HCN, HCO+, and CO fitting. Dust continuum can break this degeneracy.

=== SLED_fitting_NGC6240_3comp_Ncol_220406.ipynb ===

The fitting without dust, which shows degeneracy in abundance and H2 column density.

=== SLED_fitting_NGC6240_3comp_dust_220408.ipynb ===

Add two components dust. Cold dust temperature and mass are according to cold and dense gas component. Warm dust temperature is an independent variableï¼Œ and
dust mass is according to the sum of two warm gas components.

=== SLED_fitting_NGC6240_3comp_allmol_220410.ipynb ===

Add 13CO, CS SLEDs into fitting, using cold component dust.
